# KameleoonTestTask
Java backend test assignment for Kameleoon company

Project requirements:
  • source code should be published on https://github.com/
  • Docker image should be published on https://hub.docker.com/
  • project should have docker-compose.yaml for local deploy, OR you can deploy it on a public hosting provider (Heroku, etc)
  • use any in-memory database (Derby, H2, SQLite)
  • use Java and Spring Boot

The API should allow:
  • creation of a user account
  • addition, view, modification, and deletion of quotes.
  • voting on quotes (either upvote or downvote).
  • view of the top 10 quotes, the details of each quote, and ideally a graph of the evolution of the votes over time.
  
  Not requested: frontend part, authentication mechanism, and account rights management

The full exercise can take about 6-8 hours (for a middle-level developer; longer for a junior) but the goal is not necessarily to do everything.
More to show your development skills, respect of best practices, understanding of the web development model (client, server),
ability to deliver your work to a production-like environment, and to evaluate your productivity.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Result --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I've done the assignment. However, a lot of time was spent on learning Linux, Docker, and deploying the application on a remote server. 
Therefore, I certainly did not finish the task on time, but I leave it as a project demonstrating my skills.
As a result, the project meets all the requirements.
1) The project is published here on GitHub ✓
